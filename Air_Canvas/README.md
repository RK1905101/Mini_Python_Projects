A hand gesture controlled paint application using Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe. This project allows users to draw on a virtual canvas using hand gestures, making use of hand landmarks for color selection and drawing.

## Features ✨
- Draw with different colors using hand gestures.
- Clear the canvas with a hand gesture.
- Switch colors by moving the thumb close to the index finger.
