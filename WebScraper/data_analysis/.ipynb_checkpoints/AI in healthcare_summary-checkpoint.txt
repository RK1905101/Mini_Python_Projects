Artificial intelligence is a powerful and disruptive technology with the potential to
fundamentally transform medicine and healthcare delivery. AI systems analyze patient data to
predict health risks, diagnose diseases, and develop personalized treatment plans, thereby
assisting clinicians with decision-making. By creating more efficient workflows and enabling
better self-management of chronic illnesses, AI aims to make healthcare more personalized,
accessible, and effective. Ultimately, the goal is to improve patient care, achieve better
strategic outcomes, and potentially save lives.
