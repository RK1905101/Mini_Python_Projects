Welcome! This application uses a powerful team of AI agents, orchestrated by LangGraph, to automate the entire research
process. Just provide a detailed research topic, and the AI will conduct a literature review, run a dynamic simulation,
perform a statistical analysis, and write a professional, arXiv-style report.
