# Simon Says 😍🤩


## Rules:

* At least 3 people, but more people make for more fun

* Simon Says is the classic game that can be used anywhere from a day at the beach, to a long car ride or even a simple ice breaker. Listen closely as “Simon” gives you directions. If “Simon” says to do something, you better act fast. But, if “Simon” does not and you do it anyway, you’re out!

* One person is designated Simon, the others are the players. Standing in front of the group, Simon tells players what they must do. However, the players must only obey commands that begin with the words “Simon Says.”

If Simon says, “Simon says touch your nose,” then players must touch their nose. But, if Simon simply says, “jump,” without first saying “Simon says,” players must not jump. Those that do jump are out.




## Instructions:

* Follow directions and stay in the game for as long as possible! The last player standing wins and becomes the next Simon. If you’re Simon, the object is to try to dupe the players to follow your commands when they shouldn’t.

* We call Simon the master and commander of this game in the United States. Other countries use different names for the leader. In France, he’s called Jacques; in Hebrew, Herzl is the boss; and the Irish respect all that O’Grady says. Scandinavians have a more hierarchical view of the game: In Norway “the King commands,” and in Finland, “the Captain commands.”
