# Timed Typing Test

## Overview:

- Test and improve your typing speed and accuracy in a fun, timed environment.

- Choose from three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each level has multiple sentences to keep you challenged.

- As you type, mistakes are **highlighted in red** in real time, so you know immediately if you made an error.

- At the end of the test, your **Words Per Minute (WPM)** and **accuracy (%)** are calculated, and your highscore is saved for future sessions.

## How to Use

- Select Difficulty: Choose from Easy, Medium, Hard, or Custom.

- Choose Timer: Set your preferred duration (30s, 60s, or 120s).

- Start Test: Click Start Test and begin typing the text shown above.

- Type Accurately: Mistakes are highlighted in red â€” try to minimize them.

- Auto Sentence Addition: When you finish a sentence, a new one appears automatically.

- Track Progress:

- Watch your live WPM and errors update in real-time.

- After time runs out, your final WPM and accuracy appear.

- Set New Records: Beat your highscore and keep improving!

## How to Run:

- Make sure you have **Python 3** and **Tkinter** installed.

  - On Ubuntu/Debian:

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install python3 python3-tk
  ```

  - On Windows/macOS: Tkinter comes bundled with Python 3.
