# An extra day is added to the calendar almost every four years as February 29, and the day is called a leap day. It corrects the calendar for the fact that our planet takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the sun. A leap year contains a leap day.

# In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:

# The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
# The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
# The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
# This means that in the Gregorian calendar, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap years.

def is_leap(year):
    leap = False
    if (year%4 == 0):
        leap = True
        if (year%100 == 0):
            leap = False
            if (year%400 == 0):
                leap = True
    return leap

year = int(input("Enter the year here: "))
print(is_leap(year))

# If the given year is a leap year it outputs True else False
