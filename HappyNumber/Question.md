<b>Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.<b><hr>

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:<hr>
<ul>
<li>Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.</li>
<li>Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.</li>
<li>Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.</li>
<ul>

Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.<hr>
