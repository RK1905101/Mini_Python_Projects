📘 Overview

NumPyVision is a simple yet powerful Python utility that helps you load, view, and inspect images in the form of NumPy arrays. It’s designed for beginners and data enthusiasts who want to understand how image data is represented in numerical form — a key concept in image processing and machine learning.


⚙️ Features

✅ Load .jpg and .png images easily
✅ Convert images to RGB NumPy arrays
✅ View image shape (height, width, channels)
✅ Inspect sample pixel blocks for analysis
✅ Error handling for missing or corrupt images


💡 Applications
