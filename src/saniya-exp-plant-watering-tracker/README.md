## ðŸ“„ CSV File (`plants.csv`)
The program uses a CSV file to store plant data. This file contains three columns:  

| Column Name       | Description                                   |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `plant_name`      | Name of the plant                              |
| `last_watered`    | The last date the plant was watered (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `water_interval_days` | Number of days after which the plant needs watering |

> **Note:** If you want to track more plants, simply add new entries to this CSV file following the same format.
