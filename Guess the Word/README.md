## Guess the Word Game   
This is a classic console-based word guessing game, often known as Hangman. The player attempts to guess a hidden programming-related word letter by letter before running out of attempts.

### âœ¨ Features  
The game logic is designed to handle the following core steps:
- Random Selection: Choose a random word from a predefined list of programming and computer science terms.
- Initial Display: Display the hidden word as a series of underscores (_), separated by spaces.
- Player Input: Prompt the player to guess a single letter at a time.
- State Tracking:
  - Reveal correct guesses, updating the word's display.
  - Track and display all letters that have been tried.
  - Monitor incorrect guesses and limit the number of lives (default is 6).
- Game Conclusion: The game ends when:
  - The player successfully guesses all the letters in the word (Win).
  - The player exhausts their attempts (Loss), in which case the secret word is revealed.
