# 7 React Projects to Build in 2024

This article outlines seven React project ideas suitable for developers looking to enhance their skills in 2024. Ranging from simple to complex, these projects aim to provide practical experience and build confidence in React development. Each project includes suggested tech stacks and a brief overview of the implementation steps.

## Project Ideas:

1.  **ChatGPT AI App:** Utilize the ChatGPT API to build applications like text summarizers, translation apps, or code explainer tools. A specific example mentioned is "Draw a UI," where a user draws a UI mockup, sends it to ChatGPT, and receives the generated HTML code in return. The suggested stack is Next.js and the `tldraw` npm package, along with the `openai` npm package for API interaction.
2.  **Personal Website:** A great starting point for React beginners to familiarize themselves with JSX and CSS. Build basic components, add images, links to social media, and showcase future projects. Recommendations include Next.js for statically rendered pages (SEO-friendly), `next/image` for image optimization, and ContentLayer for managing blog posts as Markdown or MDX files.
3.  **Chat App:** A dynamic web application mimicking familiar chat applications like WhatsApp. The core components include a message area, input for new messages, and a list of contacts. Vite is recommended for project creation, and Supabase can power the backend, providing real-time chat functionality and authentication without server-side code. Supabase Storage can be used to add image and video support.
4.  **E-Commerce App:** A platform for selling physical or digital products. Start with a basic storefront featuring product images, descriptions, and a "buy" button. Next.js is suggested with Stripe integration for handling purchases. A simple database can manage inventory, updating stock levels as products are added or purchased.
5.  **Online Marketplace:** An extension of the e-commerce app, adding more products and features like customer reviews. This project introduces the challenge of implementing a shopping cart. The recommended stack is Next.js and Stripe, along with the `use-shopping-cart` package for managing the cart functionality. Supabase or a third-party service like Trustpilot can be used for handling reviews.
6.  **SaaS App (Software as a Service):** Creating a subscription-based service based on an existing app or a new creation. This could be a paid version of the AI app or chat app. Stripe or Paddle is recommended for handling subscriptions and taxes. Stripe Checkout is suggested for allowing customers to manage and cancel their subscriptions.
7.  **Real-World App Clone:** The most ambitious project involves cloning an app that the developer uses and enjoys. This requires a deep understanding of the original app's functionality and user interface. A YouTube clone is suggested, requiring the replication of features like menus, notifications, video upload/viewing, comments, and likes. Recommendations include Supabase or PlanetScale (MySQL) for the database, Next.js for the framework, TailwindCSS and Radix UI for the user interface, and Mux for video streaming. Supabase Storage can be used for storing images and media.
