### Programmatic Usage

You can also use the `EnergyTracker` class in your own scripts:

```python
from energy_tracker import EnergyTracker

# Initialize tracker with your electricity rate
tracker = EnergyTracker(electricity_rate=0.15)  # $0.15 per kWh

# Set appliance usage
tracker.set_appliance_usage("Refrigerator", 24)  # 24 hours/day
tracker.set_appliance_usage("Air Conditioner (1.5 Ton)", 8)  # 8 hours/day
tracker.set_appliance_usage("Television (LED)", 5)  # 5 hours/day

# Calculate consumption
daily_kwh = tracker.calculate_daily_consumption()
daily_cost = tracker.calculate_daily_cost()

print(f"Daily consumption: {daily_kwh:.2f} kWh")
print(f"Daily cost: ${daily_cost:.2f}")

# Display full summary
tracker.display_summary()

# Save your data
tracker.save_data()
```

## Available Appliances

The tracker includes 12 common household appliances:

## Data Persistence

Your data is automatically saved to `energy_data.json` when you use the "Save data" option. The file includes:
- Your electricity rate
- Daily usage hours for each appliance
- Last update timestamp

## Customization

### Setting Your Electricity Rate

Default rate is $0.12/kWh. To change it:

1. Select option `5` from the main menu
2. Enter your local electricity rate in $/kWh

**How to find your rate:**
- Check your electricity bill
- Look for "per kWh" or "per unit" charge
- Typical rates range from $0.08 to $0.30 per kWh

## Tips for Accurate Tracking

1. **24-hour appliances**: Refrigerators, routers typically run 24/7
2. **Variable usage**: For appliances used multiple times, estimate total daily hours
3. **Seasonal changes**: Update AC/heating usage based on season
4. **Standby power**: Many devices consume power even when "off"
5. **Check your bills**: Compare calculated costs with actual bills to validate

## Understanding Energy Consumption

**kWh (Kilowatt-hour)**: Unit of energy consumption
- 1 kWh = Running a 1000W appliance for 1 hour
- Example: 100W bulb for 10 hours = 1 kWh

**Formula:**
```
Energy (kWh) = Power (Watts) √ó Time (Hours) √∑ 1000
Cost ($) = Energy (kWh) √ó Rate ($/kWh)
```

## Energy Saving Tips üí°

Based on your consumption summary:
- Focus on top energy consumers first
- Replace high-wattage bulbs with LEDs
- Use AC wisely (biggest consumer in most homes)
- Unplug chargers when not in use
- Use natural light during the day
- Regular appliance maintenance improves efficiency
