# Python RollOver Game âœŒðŸ¤ž


## Rules:

* This is a 2-player game.

* Each player begins with one finger raised on each hand.
 On a player's turn, t hey must either attack or s plit, but not both.
 To attack, a player uses one of their live hands(Hands that have
min of 1 Finger Raised) to strike an opponent's live hand. The
number of fingers on the opponent's struck hand will increase by the
number of fingers on the hand used to strike.

* To split, a player strikes their own two hands together, and transfers
raised fingers from one hand to the other as desired.
 If any hand of any player reaches exactly five fingers, then the
hand is killed, and t his is indicated by raising zero fingers (i.e. a
closed fist).

* A player may revive their own dead hand using a split, as long as
they abide by the rules f or splitting.
 However, players may not revive opponents' hands using an attack.
Therefore, a player with two dead hands can no longer play and is
eliminated from the game.

* If any hand of any player reaches five or more fingers, then it is
considered a "dead hand".

* A player wins once all opponents are eliminated i.e by each
having two dead hands at once.
