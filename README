System Requirements Document
________________________________________
1. Hyperparameter Tuning
The system should provide the ability to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the neural network, enabling researchers and developers to optimize performance. Specific requirements include:
1.1 Adjustable Hyperparameters:
•	Number of Hidden Layers: Users must be able to increase or decrease the number of hidden layers to experiment with model depth.
•	Number of Hidden Units: Each hidden layer should allow for customization of the number of units (neurons).
•	Activation Functions: The system should support multiple activation functions such as ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh, selectable per layer.
•	Learning Rate: Users must be able to specify a learning rate for the optimizer, with support for both constant and adaptive learning rates.
•	Number of Epochs: The training process should allow the specification of the number of epochs, with visual feedback on progress.
1.2 Configuration Management:
•	A dedicated configuration file or graphical interface should be available to make changes to these parameters easily.
•	The system should maintain a history of configurations for reproducibility and comparison of experiments.

2. Validation Mechanism
To ensure the robustness of the model, the system must include a thorough validation mechanism with the following capabilities:
2.1 Misclassification Detection:
•	The system should automatically identify misclassified examples during the validation phase.
•	For each class, at least one misclassified instance must be displayed, accompanied by the predicted label and true label.
2.2 Visualization:
•	The misclassified examples should be presented in a clear and concise format, such as images with overlaid labels or tabular summaries for non-visual data.
•	Users should be able to export this information for further analysis.
2.3 Metrics:
•	The system should calculate and display common evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, for all classes.

3. Workflow Improvements
In addition to hyperparameter tuning, the system should support advanced workflow features to improve the overall accuracy of the neural network. These features include:
3.1 Data Preprocessing:
•	Support for advanced preprocessing techniques, such as normalization, standardization, and handling of missing values.
•	Options for data augmentation, including rotation, scaling, cropping, and flipping of images, to increase training data diversity.
3.2 Regularization:
•	Implementation of regularization techniques such as dropout to prevent overfitting.
•	Support for L1 and L2 regularization to control model complexity.
3.3 Alternative Architectures:
•	The system should provide templates or guidance for testing alternative architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs), depending on the dataset.
3.4 Automated Suggestions:
•	Incorporation of automated tools to recommend potential improvements, such as underutilized features or patterns in validation results.
3.5 Logging and Monitoring:
•	Continuous logging of training and validation metrics for detailed performance tracking.
•	Real-time monitoring of resource utilization, including GPU/CPU usage, memory, and training time.

Additional Notes
The system must be user-friendly and include comprehensive documentation for all features. It should also be designed to accommodate future enhancements and be compatible with industry-standard frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
